# Chef Intermediate Training

This repo contains finished examples for the Chef Intermediate Training, based on the document *Chef Intermediate Participant Guide.pdf*. There is a subfolder for each Training Day. 

There are some minor changes compared to the official training guide:
* Code is slightly changed to work without workings with Chef-Client Version: 13.2.20
* Kitchen Provider has been changed to Vagrant

If you want to make the exercise by yourself, you can clone these original repositories and follow the course guide.
